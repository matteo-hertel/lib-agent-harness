// Skills in a session. Every mechanism below was checked against the
// installed CLI (Claude Code 2.1.283, codex-cli 0.156.1, grok 1.0.41) with a
// disposable home and a local provider that performs no inference.
//
// Provided skills reach the model in one of three ways:
//
//   - Natively, where the harness loads them itself. An ordinary Claude
//     session loads a private plugin named by --plugin-dir (its skills are
//     listed as "agent-harness-skills:<name>", and a scripted Skill call under
//     dontAsk loaded the SKILL.md); it needs the Skill tool, so a
//     Policy.ClaudeTools without "Skill" takes the composed path instead. A
//     Grok session loads the same plugin through `grok agent --plugin-dir`
//     (the skill joins available_commands and the model request). A sandboxed
//     Codex session finds links in its private RuntimeHome's skills/
//     directory, which skills/list and the model request both carry under the
//     sandbox's own overrides; the operator's own Codex home is never written.
//   - As instructions: an index of the skills with each SKILL.md's absolute
//     path is appended to the session's instructions and the agent reads them
//     with its own tools. This is how an ordinary Codex session gets them, and
//     a sandboxed Claude session, whose --disable-slash-commands was observed
//     to remove every skill, a plugin's included; there the skill directories
//     are added to the sandbox's readable paths, as Sandbox.Read directories
//     are. An ordinary Claude session reading them this way gets each skill
//     directory as an --add-dir, without which dontAsk refused the read.
//   - As hosted tools: a restricted session has no native tool that could read
//     a file, so the library's load_skill (and run_skill_script, for skills
//     that permit scripts) are served beside the caller's tools, through the
//     same channel and under the same launch proof. The model sees an index of
//     them in its instructions.
//
// SkillDeliveryComposed takes the instructions path, or the hosted one in a
// restricted session, whatever the harness could do itself.
//
// Installed skills (Skills.Global) are left as each mode loads them by
// default. Include is honoured where that default already loads them: an
// ordinary session (for Claude, one whose tools keep "Skill"). Exclude is
// honoured where the default already loads none: a restricted session, which
// has no native tool that could use one, and a sandboxed Claude session. No
// CLI offers a verified switch that removes installed skills and nothing else
// (Claude's --setting-sources= also drops the operator's hooks and permission
// rules; Codex's skills.bundled.enabled=false leaves ~/.agents and repository
// skills), so every other request is refused.
//
// Scripts. With native or instruction delivery the agent runs a skill's
// scripts with its own shell, under the session's own policy and inside its
// sandbox when it has one; providing a skill grants no permission, and
// Skill.Scripts is stated in the index but cannot be enforced against an
// agent's own shell. With hosted delivery Skill.Scripts is enforced: only a
// permitting skill gets run_skill_script, and each call runs as SkillRun says.

// SkillRunOptions says how a restricted session's hosted run_skill_script, or
// a handler from SkillTools, runs a skill's scripts. It has the shape of
// completion.SkillRunOptions.
