// Package account reports who is logged in to a CLI harness and what their
// usage draws on, in one shape for every engine.
//
// Usage on a harness is paid for by up to three independent systems, and this
// package reports them side by side rather than combining them, because only
// the application knows which one its users care about:
//
//   - Quota: subscription allowance windows, such as a five-hour session
//     window and a weekly window, each a percentage used with a reset time.
//     A percentage is never converted into a token or message count.
//   - Cost: token spend valued at API rates. It belongs to a turn or run, not
//     to an account, so it is reported by the execution modes (harness.Cost)
//     and only when the harness reports it.
//   - Credits: a prepaid or overage balance that can pay for usage beyond a
//     quota window, or instead of one.
//
// Every part of a harness.AccountReport is present and says whether it is
// known. An unknown part is never zero, unlimited or free: its Reason says
// why it is unknown, including when the engine cannot report it at all.
//
// Inspection performs no inference and creates no conversation. It reads the
// selected CLI's own native login, in a disposable working directory.
