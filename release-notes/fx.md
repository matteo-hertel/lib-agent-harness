# fx support (unreleased)

Adds `harness.Fx` (`"fx"`), a CLI engine for fx, the terminal coding agent
whose CLI is installed as `fx`. Every shape was checked against fx 0.0.14.

fx is offered in all three execution modes it can carry:

- **Sessions** run `fx acp` over the Agent Client Protocol. A session starts,
  resumes, interrupts and steers (composed), with streamed text, tool started
  and completed events, the turn's own usage, and the context window fx itself
  states.
- **Native runs** are one `fx ask --json`. fx states no output schema, so a
  structured request is refused.
- **Model discovery** reads `fx models --json`, and **account inspection**
  reads `fx status` and `fx credits`, in a temporary directory, with no
  inference and no conversation.

What fx cannot carry is refused rather than approximated:

- The mode, the model and the effort are set as the session's own
  configuration and read back from what fx reports. fx's `session/set_mode`
  answers with nothing, so it is not used: a mode that cannot be read back is
  a permission the library will not run with. A model or effort fx would
  substitute is refused before the first prompt.
- Every session runs in fx's asking mode, so fx asks before every action that
  changes anything. New `Policy.FxPermission` answers those requests:
  `FxDenyWhenAsked` (the default) or `FxAllowWhenAsked`, never an "always"
  option. fx's own tools stay available, so an fx session is not a read-only
  mode.
- A permission request that offers two options of the same kind or the same id
  is answered cancelled, so a deny can never be read as an allow.
- fx appends session instructions to its own system prompt and offers no way
  to replace it, so a replace request is refused.
- fx keeps its profile in the user's home directory and has no variable that
  moves it, so a home that names another directory is refused. A session
  inherits none of fx's own `FX_` variables and refuses them as additions,
  except the operator's own protective switches `FX_MAX_AGENT_STEPS`,
  `FX_ULTRAFAST` and `FX_AUTO_UPGRADE`, whose bounds, cost and network
  choices are preserved. fx has no environment variable that carries a privacy
  guarantee: its Zero Data Retention control is a Gateway account setting.
- `Complete` is unsupported: fx offers no way to prove its native tools are
  absent. Restricted, sandboxed, browser and compacted sessions, hosted caller
  tools, and fx quota are unsupported too.

New native failure code `CodeHomeUnsupported`. `Policy` gains a field, so
unkeyed (positional) `Policy` literals no longer compile; keyed literals are
unaffected. Existing engines, references and digests are unchanged.

A session's `Resume` reports a conversation fx no longer holds as
`errConversationGone`, and a permission request that offers no option the
session's policy wants is answered cancelled, so no permission and no answer
is ever guessed.
